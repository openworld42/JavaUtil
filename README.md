# JavaUtil - Lightweight Java utilities to support straightforward development

Java classes for the daily demands in practice.

If you like it (better: if it helped you) please give a star - to motivate me. 

**To use it:** simply copy over the files you want to use and delete the parts or files you don't need, or reference the jar file of a release.

Don't repeat the boring tasks, don't re-invent the wheel. JavaUtil tried to keep it simple but functional, 
thus reducing unnecessary complexity. Whenever possible, it makes use  of POJOs (Plain Old Java Object), uses the KISS (Keep it simple [and] stupid) and "Clean Code" (easy to understand) principle.

JavaUtil is not a framework, and it has **no dependencies**. You use it or modify it, deleting the unnecessary parts. Use the saved time for other things you like.
