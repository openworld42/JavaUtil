# JavaUtil is still in a formation process - but you can watch things grow.

<br />
<br />


Java classes for the daily demands in practice. 

:airplane: **[Click here if you just want the latest release jar file.](https://github.com/openworld42/JavaTemplate/blob/master/template_v1.1.0.jar)**

:mechanic: **To use it:** simply copy over the files you want to use into your project and delete the methods, parts or files you don't need, or reference the **jar file** of a release. 

> [!NOTE]
> **JavaUtil** needs a Java version of **17+**, due to modern language features. ([download Java](https://openjdk.org/))

:thinking: **JavaUtil** tries to keep it simple but functional, 
thus reducing unnecessary complexity. Whenever possible, it makes use  of POJOs (Plain Old Java Object), and uses the KISS (Keep it simple [and] stupid) and "Clean Code" (easy to understand) principle. Don't repeat the boring tasks, don't re-invent the wheel. 

:electron: **JavaUtil** is not a framework, and it has **no dependencies**. You use it or modify it, possibly deleting the unnecessary parts. Use the saved time for other things you like.
